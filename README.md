# Predicting-Bike-Trips-at-a-Rental
In this project I will be predicting "Number of Bike Trips" for a rental company. The work flow consists of Data Processing, creating qualitative predictors, implementing multiple linear regression, dealing with collinearity, exploring different regression models.


For this problem we’ll be working with two years of the bicycle sharing systems for New York City (Citibike). The dataset contains daily bike trip counts, along with daily measurements on environmental and seasonal information that may affect the bikesharing.

Here’s information on what the variables mean.

trips - daily total number of bike trips taken (all stations)

precipitation - daily inches of rain

snow_depth - daily inches of snow. Accoding to NOAA "Determine the depth of the new and old snow remaining on the ground at observation time".

snowfall - according to NOAA "Measure and record the snowfall (snow, ice pellets ) since the previous snowfall observation (24 hours)."

max_temperature - daily maximum temperature in Farenheit (highest temperature reached)

min_temperature - daily minimum temperature in Farenheit (lowest temperature reached)

average_wind_speed - measured hourly in mph and averaged for daily value
